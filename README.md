# TeamFiltration - AccountImporter
Account Importer for TeamFiltration (https://github.com/Flangvik/TeamFiltration) in case verification does not work.
It takes a text file with emails, one per line, and appends them to the TeamFiltration database.

Example
```
.\LiteDB-Account-Importer.exe TeamFiltration.db users.txt
```
